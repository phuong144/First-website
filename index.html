         <h3>About me</h3>                 
         <p class="aboutme">I am currently going into my second year of college at UC Santa Cruz! Having taken basic courses in Java and C, I aim to gain a stronger sense of coding fundamentals, including algorithms and data structures, so that I can have a solid base of understanding going into more difficult material and concepts. I enjoy teaching myself new coding concepts and am currently doing so through reading texts and practicing code. </p>         
         
         <h3>Activities & Interests</h3>
         <p class="other">Besides coding, hobbies that I like to enjoy include music and fitness. Working out has been a fun, new, and exciting hobby for me. It also works perfectly when I want to release some stress when debugging code! In addition, I also enjoy playing and listening to music. Lastly, I like to spend my time with friends and family because they mean the world to me, and I truly enjoy time spent sharing experiences with any of them.</p>
         
         <h3>Other</h3>
         <p>Making this website was very tough as I went straight out of the CodeCademy lessons. Even after accomplishing the tutorial, I still found myself lost in many of the properties and values, which selectors work, div and class groupings, etc. I'm not an expert at HTML and CSS but this project definitely helped me understand the concepts a lot more. I actually enjoyed coding this and constantly learning more material through research.</p>
